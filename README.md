Movie Searcher is a web application designed for searching movies and viewing movie details. Users can discover upcoming movies, search for specific titles, and view the details.

The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, while movie data is fetched through the API.

Accessible through HTML files in any browser, Movie Searcher aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly movie exploration experience.

This repository is created for the final requirement in my course IT 11.
